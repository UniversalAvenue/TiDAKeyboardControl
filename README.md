Do you want to create a perfect clone of the iMessage compose interface? ***Fear no more!*** You can now respond to keyboard events (show, hide, and realtime interactive changes) and customize how much space will be used as an offset during interactive panning.

Titanium SDK wrapper for the awesome [DAKeyboardControl][dakc] from [@danielamitay][da]! (iOS only)

### Installation

You can install this module using [gitTio][gittio-cli] with

    gittio install it.smc.dakeyboardcontrol

Alternatively you can [download a specific release][rls] for manual installation.

Usage overview
--------------

```js
var textarea = Ti.UI.createTextArea({
	right: 0,
	bottom: 0,
	left: 0,
	scrollable: false,
	suppressReturn: false,
	height: Ti.UI.SIZE,
});

var window = Ti.UI.createWindow({
	// How much space must be took on top of the keyboard
	keyboardTriggerOffset: 0,
	// This activates the panning feature
	keyboardPanning: true,
	// Automatically add the textarea as a locked view
	lockedViews: [ textarea ]
});

window.addEventListener('close', function (event) {
	// Very important! Releases what needs to be released
	event.source.keyboardPanning = false;
});

window.add(textarea);

// The window is now the host for keyboard events
window.addEventListener('keyboardchange', function (event) {
	Ti.API.error("Notification of keyboard change: y=" + event.y + " height="+event.height);
});

// Multiline text-area
textarea.addEventListener('postlayout', function (event) {
	window.keyboardTriggerOffset = event.source.rect.height;
});

window.open();
```
